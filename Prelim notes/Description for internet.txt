What is the meaning of Internet?

	
Internet is the short term for "Internetwork". It is also defined as
 the "Network of Networks". The Internet connects millions of people
 around the
 world and is used mostly for communication and accessing 
information. Computers can connect with each other as long as they are 
connected to the
 Internet. The informations that travel through
 the internet via variety of languages that are called Protocols. 

	
Every person that is using the internet has a unique Internet Protocol
(IP) address 
	- unique numbers that are used to identify each computer
 that is connected to the Internet Protocol that are communicating in a 
network.

 
Versions of IP Address
	
1. IPv4 - 32 bits long
	
2. IPv6 - 128 bits long
