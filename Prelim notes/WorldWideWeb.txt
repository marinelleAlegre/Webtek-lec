The World Wide Web contains information and is capable of sharing it 
over to the ones who are able to access it. 
This can be done over the 
access of the Internet. In here, it will share information about 
particularly any topic that has been collected and could be
 translated 
in how you want it to be. 

It uses the HTTP protocol to be able to 
transmit data. 

The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) allows the 
exchanging of 
business logic by letting applications communicate with each other and 
they are able to share information through the use of the Web.

 The Web
 does not only contain text documents of information but these
 documents could contain graphics, sounds, and videos.
 It uses browsers 
like the Internet Explorer of Firefox for the purpose of accessing
 information from Web Pages that are supposed to be linked to each
other
 with the use of hyperlinks. 

The World Wide Web that is accessed
 over the use of the Internet has become the main source to our everyday
 working life 
because we rely on the internet for references that is 
related or could be of help to our work. People need to do some research
 in order to understand 
or get more information about the work they are 
doing to be able to accomplish it. They should have enough or some 
advanced knowledge in order to be 
successful in doing their work with 
the right resources.
