										<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
										<p>PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.</p>

									<p>COMMON USES OF PHP<br>
- PHP performs system functions, i.e. from files on a system it can create, read, write, and close.<br>

- PHP can handle forms, i.e. gather data from files, save data to a file, through email you can send data, return data to the user.<br>

- You add, delete, modify elements within your database through PHP.<br>

- Access cookies variables and set cookies.<br>

- Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website.<br>

- It can encrypt data.</p></br>

									<p>ENVIRONMENTAL SET-UP<br>
									 a) Web Server − PHP will work with virtually all Web Server software, including Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) but then most often used is freely available Apache Server. 
									<br>

b) Database − PHP will work with virtually all database software, including Oracle and Sybase but most commonly used is freely available MySQL database. <br>

c) PHP Parser − In order to process PHP script instructions a parser must be installed to generate HTML output that can be sent to the Web Browser. This tutorial will guide you how to install PHP parser on your computer.</p></br>

									<p>PHP - ERROR & EXCEPTION HANDLING<br>
									a) Error handling is the process of catching errors raised by your program and then taking appropriate action. If you would handle errors properly then it may lead to many unforeseen consequences.<br>
									b) Programs rarely work correctly the first time. Many things can go wrong in your program that cause the PHP interpreter to generate an error message. You have a choice about where those error messages go. The messages can be sent along with other program output to the web browser. They can also be included in the web server error log.To make error messages display in the browser, set the display_errors configuration directive to On. To send errors to the web server error log, set log_errors to On. You can set them both to On if you want error messages in both places.

									<p>GET AND POST METHOD <br>
									There are two ways the browser client can send information to the web server.<br>

                                    - The GET Method <br>
                                    - The POST Method<br>
                           Before the browser sends the information, it encodes it using a scheme called URL encoding. In this scheme, name/value pairs are joined with equal signs and different pairs are separated by the ampersand.<br>
                            The GET Method <br>
                              -The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. The page and the encoded information are separated by the ? character.<br>
                              The POST Method <br>
                              -The POST method transfers information via HTTP headers. The information is encoded as described in case of  GET method and put into a header called QUERY_STRING.<br>

										<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
										<p>It demonstrates how PHP can provide dynamic content according to browser type, randomly generated numbers or User Input. It also demonstrated how the client browser can be redirected.</p>

									<p> PHP AND XML <br>
										XML is a mark-up language to share the data across the web, XML is for both human read-able and machine read-able. Example of share-able xmls are RSS Feeds. XML parsers are useful to read and update the data by using web browsers.<br>
                                       There are two big differences between XML and HTML: <br>

                                     - XML doesn't define a specific set of tags you must use.<br>
                                     - XML is extremely picky about document structure.<br>

									<p>PHP Frame Works <br>
									Frame Work is collection of software or program, that trigger off easy coding and implementing the code. It helps to programmer to achieve goals in short period of time. If PHP code is integrated with frame works, you can do anything with php coding skills</p>
