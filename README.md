Step on how to make a HTML Website

Step 1: Open Notepad (PC)
Windows 8 or later:

Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad.

Windows 7 or earlier:

Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad

Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac)
Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit

Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose "Plain Text"

Then under "Open and Save", check the box that says "Ignore rich text commands in HTML files".

Then open a new document to place the code.

Step 2: Write Some HTML
Write or copy some HTML into Notepad.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Website</h1>

<p>Hello World</p>

</body>
</html>

Step 3: Save the HTML Page
Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu.
Name the file "index.html" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files).
You can use either .htm or .html as file extension. There is no difference, it is up to you.

Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser
Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").
And you will see the result that youve done in your website.
